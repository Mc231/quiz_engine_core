/// A utility class for randomly selecting items from a list.
///
/// The `RandomItemPicker` class provides functionality to pick random items
/// from a list, offering a selection of options with one correct answer.
/// It is designed to facilitate quiz or game scenarios where random options
/// need to be presented to the user. The class manages previously selected
/// items to ensure variety in subsequent picks.
///
/// The class can be configured with a specific number of options to pick,
/// and defaults to a count of 4 options if not specified.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// final itemPicker = RandomItemPicker(['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry']);
/// RandomPickResult result = itemPicker.pick();
/// print('Answer: ${result.answer}, Options: ${result.options}');
/// ```
class RandomItemPicker<T> {
  /// The list of items from which random selections are made.

  /// The number of options to include in each pick.

  ///
  /// [items] is the list of items available for random selection.
  /// [count] is the number of options to pick; defaults to [_defaultCount] (4).

  ///
  /// This method clears the existing list of items and replaces it with
  /// the provided [items]. It is useful for resetting the item pool between
  /// rounds or sessions.

  /// options, ensuring that one of the options is the correct answer.
  ///
  /// Returns a `RandomPickResult` containing the answer and options, or `null`
  /// if there are no items available for picking.
